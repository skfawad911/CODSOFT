<h1>Task</h1>

<h2>Task 1: To-Do List</h2>

A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently using Python and the Tkinter library. This simple application allows users to add, remove, and update tasks, and it features a visually appealing design.

üìù To-Do List Functionality

The To-Do List functionality includes the following features:

--> Adding Tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

--> Removing Tasks: To remove a task, users select it from the list and click the "Remove" button.

--> Updating Tasks: Users can select a task from the list, edit it in the input field, and click the "Update" button to modify it.

<h2>Task 2: Calculator</h2>

In this project, I've created a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Calculator application using Python and the Tkinter library. This simple application allows users to input numbers and an operation choice, perform the calculation and display the result.

üñ© Calculator Functionality

The Calculator includes the following features:

--> A simple GUI based calculator.

--> Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

--> Provide a clear button and a display for calculations.

--> Use Python and Tkinter Library.


<h2>Task 3: Password Generator</h2>

In this project, I've created a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Password Generator application using Python and the Tkinter library. A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

üîê Password Generator Code Summary

This application is build using Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library for generating and copying random passwords. The application allows the user to select the **complexity level (Weak, Medium, or Strong)** and the **desired length** for the password. When the **"Generate Password"** button is clicked, a password of the specified complexity and length is **generated and displayed** in a text field. The user can then **copy this password** to the clipboard using the **"Copy"** button. The GUI includes radio buttons to choose the complexity, a spinbox to select the password length, and labels and buttons for various actions. It also uses the **pyperclip library** to handle copying the generated password to the clipboard.
